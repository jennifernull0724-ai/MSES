        <h1>About Mid-South Environmental Services</h1>
        <p className="established-badge">Established 2017</p>
        <p>Mid-South Environmental Services is a privately owned environmental response and support company serving regulated operating environments across the Mid-South. The company provides field-executed environmental services for railroad, industrial, transportation, and marine operations where timing, coordination, and control matter.</p>
        <p>We first opened our doors in Nesbit, MS during 2017. We have since moved our corporate office to Southaven, MS and have been proudly serving the Mid-South since then. We expanded our operation in 2020 and opened a second office in Little Rock, AR.</p>
        <p>Operations are led directly by ownership with hands-on involvement in both emergency response and planned work. Services are delivered with a practical focus on containment, site coordination, and safe execution—without unnecessary delays or layers of approval.</p>
        <p>Mid-South Environmental Services supports clients from initial response through resolution, working alongside operations, compliance, and site personnel to manage environmental incidents and maintenance activities efficiently. The company's approach is grounded in real-world field experience, clear communication, and direct accountability at every stage.</p>
